<!-- ✅ 1️⃣ Why we use type="module" ?
<script src="./dist/index.js" type="module"></script>
What is this?
🔹 What it does:
When you use:
type="module"
What is this?
It tells the browser:
"This JavaScript file is an ES Module."
That means you can use:

import ...
export ...
Without type="module"
import / export will NOT work
Everything becomes global
Not industry standard

✅ 2️⃣ Why we use defer ?
Normally:
<script src="file.js"></script>
What is this?
Browser:
Stops HTML parsing
Loads JS
Executes JS
Then continues HTML
❌ This blocks page rendering.
With defer:
<script src="file.js" defer></script>
What is this?
Browser:
Parses full HTML first
Then runs JS
DOM is ready
⚡ Important:
👉 When you use type="module"
You DO NOT need defer
Because:
Modules are deferred automatically.
So this is enough:
<script type="module" src="./dist/index.js"></script>
What is this?
✔ Industry correct
❌ No need to write defer -->
